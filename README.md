# lazyjira

A Terminal UI for Jira.

Heavily inspired by these awesome tools:

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)
- [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)

Using `lazyjira` you can:

- Do nothing at the moment

## Local Development

### Setup

- Activate [hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/)
- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:
  ```shell
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit install -t commit-msg
  ```

### Git

- Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec

> [!TIP]
> Use the pre-installed `comet` CLI to make writing commit messages easier.
